  
# Defuzzification methods

1.  Max-membership principle
    
2.  Centroid method
    
3.  weighted average method
    
4.  mean max membership
    
5.  Center of sums
    
6.  Center of largest area
    
7.  First of maximum, last of maximum


## Max-Membership principle 
- also know as height method
- maximum membership value z* is the defuzzified value
- this principle can be applied only for peaked output function
- μA​(z*) >= μA​`(z) 

## Centroid Method
- also known as center of mass, center of area or center of gravity method
